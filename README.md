# Goals
Pickerel is a chess engine implemented in Rust. We decided to build a chess engine as we are both avid chess players, and we think that such a project plays perfectly to Rust's strengths.

# Possible Challenges
There are several challenges that are inherent to a project like this. First of all, the success of any artificial intelligence project like this is highly dependent on the creation ot a robust and useful heuristic. If we can't determine a way to accurately evaluate the utility of a given position, our algorithm will not be able to efficiently determine the best moves to make. Second, this project will be highly dependent on computational efficiency. It will be crucial that we optimize every possible component of our project so that our algorithm can check as many states as possible in a reasonable amount of time.
